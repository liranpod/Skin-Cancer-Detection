This is for the Kaggle competition **ISIC 2024 - Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-TBP**.

I have experimented with the data, and made a model that reads tabular data that predicts whether a lesion is malignant or benign.
This tabular data is metadata of photos taken by patients.

Data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge/data
